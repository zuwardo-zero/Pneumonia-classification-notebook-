# ü´Å Pneumonia Classification Notebook  

Created by **Mohamed Islam Hadjaz** and **Adel Derradj**  

A deep learning project focused on the **detection and classification of respiratory illnesses** (pneumonia and related conditions) using chest X-ray images.  
The model was trained to classify X-ray images into **three classes**.

## üìå Project Overview
Pneumonia remains one of the most common respiratory diseases, and early detection through medical imaging can greatly improve treatment outcomes.  
This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied in **medical image analysis** for classification tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   -  handled dataset samples (over 22000 x-ray images from a kaggle dataset)
   - Balanced classes where possible  
2. **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
   - Image resizing, normalization  
   - Augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zoom) 
3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Plotted class distribution and sample X-rays  
4. **Data Splitting**  
   - [Training 70% / Validation 20% / Test 10%] sets created for fair evaluation  
5. **Model Development**  
   - Deep learning CNN with ~100 MB parameters  
   - Trained on Kaggle cloud services for faster results  
6. **Evaluation & Validation**  
   - Accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix analysis
